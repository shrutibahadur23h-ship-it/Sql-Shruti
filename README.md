# Project Overview : SQL Fundamentals
Introduction

This project is designed to help understand the foundational concepts of SQL, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Query Language (DQL). It provides practical exposure to how SQL is used in real-world business scenarios.

Additionally, the project offers hands-on experience in automation and testing, enabling learners to apply SQL in end-to-end workflows involving data generation, validation, and comparison.

Project Goal & Objective

This project consists of 10 key tasks that collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of SQL. It  covers the fundamental concepts such as DDL, DML, and DQL and also demonstrates how SQL is applied in real-world business scenarios

Req1     
Generate a random data input files
a) Feed-1  which has 10 columns with 10 rows,
b) Feed-2 which has 15 columns with 15 rows ,
c) Feed-3 which has 20 columns  with 20 rows

Req2
Automate the Req 1 input file generation using SQL  scripts and the parameter will be "Feed name" & Number of Rows to populate Data

Req3
Write SQL script to identify the duplicate (rows) in each of the table Feed-1, 2, 3

Req4
Write the duplicate records in output file - "duplicates"

Req5
Create a script to replace all the duplicates with Unique rows and update back to respective Feed table

Req6
Execute the duplicate script and check the output is zero

Req7
Create SQL script to compare data from Feed-2,3 to Feed-1 and write in output file on the compared results

Req8
Create Test plan with all kinds of manual test cases in order to test this End to End functionality

Req9
Automate the test cases (if possible) using any method but should be automatedâ€¦

Req 10
Document everything in word with all screen grabs as proper Project Document
